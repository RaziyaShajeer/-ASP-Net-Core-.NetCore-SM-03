Stored Procedure
-----------------------
A stored procedure is a set of SQL commands that has been compiled and stored on the datatbase server.
Once the stored procedure has been stored,client applications can execute the stored procedure over and 
over again without sending it to the database server again and without compiling it again.
Stored procedures improve performance by reducing network traffic and CPU load.
